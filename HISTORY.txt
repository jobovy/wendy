2020-04-21: v0.2
=================

- Added different options for performing the necessary sort in the
  approximate version of the algorithm: mergesort, quicksort, timsort,
  as well as a parallel mergesort (which is, however, not very
  efficient).

- Added option to add an arbitrary external force F(x,t) to the
  approximate version of the algorithm.

- Added an example of using wendy to generate a phase-space spiral
  similar to that observed by Gaia, through a simple perturbation of
  the Galactic disk (examples/GaiaPhaseSpaceSpiral.ipynb).

- First release
